# Network

This component provides some abstractions for network access, such as convenience for return types,
`Promise` integration, automatic metrics collection, etc.

It is quite heavily inspired by `URLSession` and `URLSessionDataTask` on iOS.

# TODO

* Provide an implementation for `fetch` (not sure if it even fits the API, or whether we want to do
  that, but perhaps someone more familiar with JavaScript can give me some guidance here).
